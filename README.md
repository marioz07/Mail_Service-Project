## Features

* User Registration: The project allows users to create new accounts by filling out the Sign-Up form. Each user is assigned a unique login ID and must provide a correct password for enhanced security.
* Secure Communication: The Mailing System ensures the security and privacy of user messages. Unauthorized users are restricted from accessing or viewing the messages.
* Password Recovery: In case a user forgets their password, the system provides a password recovery feature, allowing them to regain access to their account.
* Restricted Access: Only registered users are granted access to the system. This prevents any unauthorized users or hackers from infiltrating the platform.
